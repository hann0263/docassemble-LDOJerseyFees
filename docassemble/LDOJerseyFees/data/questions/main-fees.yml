  This tool will help you to prepare instructions for Orders that amend fees.
  
  You **should** use this tool if:
  
  *  You are preparing instructions to change the amount of an existing fee (or fees); and
  *  The fee can be amended by Order.
  
  You **should not** use this tool if:
  
  *  You are creating a new fee regime; or
  *  The fee you wish to change cannot be amended by Order (because, for example, it needs to be done by Regulations or an amendment Law).
  
  Before starting, you will need to know:
  
  * The legislation that sets the fee you wish to amend;
  * The legislation that allows the fee to be set or amended;
  * The current amount of the fee;
  * The new amount of the fee; and
  * The reason for the change.
